        <h1 id="thorne-valley">Thorne Valley</h1>

<p>The first settlement to be established in the green valley was in the year 2642. This small settlement of Vific humans that came across the Iron Sea, dubbed the new holding of man, Blue Rose. It was not long after they discovered the old ruins of a city, made with pre-age of guile architecture, though to be made by the dragons of old.</p>

<h2 id="elderacre">Elderacre</h2>
<p>Elderacre is an old city but quite how old no mortal can say. It was built atop ruins which had been believed to be made by the first dragon families. The sewers and caverns beneath its well-trodden streets run deep and many who had gone exploring have not returned. Still, others have returned mad or struck mute by what they saw.</p>

<p>Elderare’s location in the Thorne Valley, nestled between tributaries of the Green Na’al, makes it ideally suited as a port city. The Business of Elderacre is trading, and business is good. Boats travel up the Green Na’al and back again daily, fat with cargo. Ships sail out the mouths of the rivers and South-West through the Inner Sea, or north through the Iron Sea, bound for Tumin, or The Twisting Islet near the Roof of the World. Her walls are high and the hill holding the Rose Palace aloft above the urban landscape, the city thick with docks, taverns, inns, workshops, stables, tanneries, and brothels.</p>

<p>Inside the city gates, the city is crammed with buildings and market stalls, all of which are of a cream colour. As one moves closer towards the city centre one finds the streets become cleaner, the buildings taller and more ornate, and the clothing of the people more richly decorated. Temples to every Grand can be found in the inner city, as well as guild houses, counting houses, and embassies. At The centre lies the Rose Palace.</p>

<h3 id="rose-palace">Rose Palace</h3>
<p>The ruler Queen Leofrun, of Thorne Valley is currently the Rose of the region. Her family has sat atop of the throne since 3191, and Thorne Valley Has mostly prospered in that time. It was Leofrun’s great-grandmother that joined the Red Legion in the eastern Ashley Mountains, ending centuries of conflict and minor wars between the people of Thorne Valley and the Dragons of the Red Legion in 3202.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the ruler of Thorne Valley is always a woman, although it is not a law. Still, if asked, most would tell you they simply wouldn’t trust a man on the throne.</p>

<p>Queen Leofrun is aided in her rule of the city and its holdings by the Six Petals. These are the highest and most powerful noble families of Thorne Valley and, some suspect, the real power in the city. The Six Petals have the authority to remove the Queen with a two- thirds vote and there are constant power games between the houses in attempts to gain leverage over the other and also more favour with the queen. Assassinations are rare but have been known to happen from time to time. The last one happened in the year 3191 when Mad Queen Saxleue was assassinated and Leofrun’s great-grandmother, Queen Lorimer took the throne.</p>

<p>Thorne Valley, like most all cities, has a powerful and well-entrenched underworld that many belief operates with the full knowledge of the Rose Palace and Leofrun’s intelligence network, called The Birds. There are rumours about of a secret peace between the criminal elements and the Throne but anyone who claims to have knowledge of such an arrangement usually ends up feeding the river sharks at the bottom of the Green Na’al.</p>

<p>The weather is moderate and changeable most days with sudden rain storms that can blow in off the Iron Sea with little to no warning. The people of Thorne Valley are a bawdy and festive bunch and always seem to have a twinkle in their eye as if they know is something you don’t. The Thorne Valley women take pleasure in wearing silken clothing that leaves little to the imagination and practices great care in accentuating their beauty. Don’t mistake them for soft delicate flowers, though. Many have a blade concealed somewhere in those lustrous folds and are not shy about using them. Men in the lower classes also often go about shirtless and in breeches as well.</p>

<h3 id="the-vedmark-order">The Vedmark Order</h3>
<p>The Vedmark is an order of specialized hunters that work in the name of the queen to rid Thorns Valley of horrific monsters. With the events of <strong>__</strong> Queen Saxleue declare that an order made of the most decorated warriors in her army is to be lead by her personal knight Morten Andersson, who served as a Vedmark in till he died of old age in <strong>__</strong>. In its early days, under the rule of Queen Saxleue, the Vedmark was responsible for the death of 13 dragons veterans, this did not settle well with the Red Legion when they finally won the war with Thorne Valley Does not like the Violet Militia as they feel like they are overstepping their bonds as a militia and are not ready to take on monsters.</p>

<h3 id="bandits-of-bastard-hill">Bandits Of Bastard Hill</h3>
<p>Home to several bandit clans all descended from a regiment of Thorne Valley troops who rebelled when Queen Lorimer submitted the Thorne Valley to the Red Legion. Travel in this region is risky if one does not have heavy guards or a heavy coin purse with which to bribe the bandits. The informal leader of the bandit’s clans is an ageing former captain of the Thorne Valley Infantry named Dash.</p>

<p>Dash’s family lived in the far eastern town of Hemmings Grove which was burnt to the ground in a retaliation war by the Red Legion while he was pulling guard duty in Elderacre. His wife and young daughter were killed and when Queen Lorimer made peace and accepted the Burning Concordat a short time later he felt betrayed. Afterwards, he and most of his regiment rebelled and turned against their queen. There is an outstanding price on Dash’s head and smaller rewards for the heads of any of the Bandits Of Bastard Hill.</p>
