Who holds the power?
Perhaps this is the source of some of my recent issues
Many settings do not clearly define who holds power and (more importantly) how they hold it
Do great warriors hold power over the masses?Elite armies? Do the people themselves hold power? Religious groups? Mages? Scientists? Assassins? Corporations?
Many GMs seem to assume the PCs will be 'adventurers' (mercenaries, thieves, plunderers). But many types of government are actively hostile to this type of individual. Creating plot holes when the 'adventurers' are not treated with active hostility
It makes sense for an 'old west' sheriff to welcome some wandering helpers. He is a civil servant and focused only on getting his job done.
But a feudal baron holds power by providing protection to his serfs and holding the threat of force against them. He is a warlord. He must be the strongest fighter around (or appear to be). He must be the solution to any problem the serfs have. He cannot withstand a popular rival.
The source of their political power determines their entire attitude and many of their allegiances
Without knowing and understanding that source it becomes very difficult to write effectively
Who holds the power in your setting?
