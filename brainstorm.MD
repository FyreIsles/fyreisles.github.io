Who holds the power?
Perhaps this is the source of some of my recent issues
Many settings do not clearly define who holds power and (more importantly) how they hold it
Do great warriors hold power over the masses?Elite armies? Do the people themselves hold power? Religious groups? Mages? Assassins?
Do not assume that the PCs will be 'adventurers' (mercenaries, thieves, plunderers). But many types of government are actively hostile to this type of individual. Creating plot holes when the 'adventurers' are not treated with active hostility
It makes sense for an 'old west' sheriff to welcome some wandering helpers. He is a civil servant and focused only on getting his job done.
But a feudal baron holds power by providing protection to his serfs and holding the threat of force against them. He is a warlord. He must be the strongest fighter around (or appear to be). He must be the solution to any problem the serfs have. He cannot withstand a popular rival.
The source of their political power determines their entire attitude and many of their allegiances
Without knowing and understanding that source it becomes very difficult to write effectively
Who holds the power in your setting?



Authors Note: This is a re-write of the common used magic system in most OGL this is intended as an optional rule, if you or your play group decide not to use this system that is your choice, much of the story is written with this system in mind so the actual interaction with the NPC of the world may very slightly from normal if using a different magic system.
Magica: What is it?
Magic is loosely defined as a mystical force that is omnipresent and wieldable by those that train or are naturally gifted in its use, it also has its own effects on creating creatures that are intrinsically linked or bonded through magic. Most fantasy creatures fall under this category, such as Unicorns, Dragons ect.
In the World of Sasai, Magica is an omnipresent force, but it is pure chaos, uncontrollable and fickle in its forms. Magica created the planes through the Aetherwinds the pure unbridled forces of magical chaos. The Aetherwinds created the planes that all life lives on, but the gods took it upon themselves to give those planes life and meaning, each sculpting the creatures and inhabitants of each plane to their desires, and needs.
Magica has no master not even the gods can directly control Magica without risk of falling to its fickle ways so they used they’re divine power to create life and give the planes meaning,
Using Magica: 
Magica can’t simply be learned or used, it is a wild force that batters those that try to use it. Practitioners have found ways of sheltering themselves against the effects of the forces of chaos by channeling it through spirits and other supernatural entities that they form unique bonds with. The form of the bond is unique to each practitioner, but the same general principle is shared throughout, the Magica wielder must form either a pact, or bond with some form of spirit or creature. The following delves deeper in the mechanical rules involving magic in the world of Sasai.
Arcane Casting
All Arcane based caster classes (non-divine based caster) are granted a familiar as the Wizard Class feature, with the exception that it must be a familiar and cannot be a bound item. There is two major changes to this granted ability, the familiar can take any shape the character would like and has all the bonuses associated with having a familiar with the following exception, the familiar can have the Ghost Template but cannot directly attack anything, it is simply a way for the caster to channel their magic, secondly the innate bonus granted by having a familiar is exclusively a +2 circumstance bonus to Use Magic Device skill. No other bonus can be chosen.
Note: If a class gains a familiar as an ability it is unaltered by these limitations. And can grant any of the listed bonuses in the familiar table list.
Whenever an arcane magic user (non-divine based caster) casts a spell, roll on the following table (Table 3-6: Wild Magic) to determine the Wild Magic effect before the spell is cast, but apply the effect after the spell is cast unless it alters the spell itself in some way (such as changing the effective caster level). Any reference on the table to the spell or the spell's level applies to the spell being cast, supernatural ability being used, or magic item effect being activated. Similarly, any reference to the caster applies to the character who triggers the wild magic. If an effect requires a caster level, use the caster's full character level. 
Note: This does not affect supernatural and spell-like abilities, the winds of magic are only fickle to those that try to harness their power, not those that are born into the chaos.
Divine Casting:
Divine casters or characters that receive their power directly from a god or deity are not affected from wild magic and have no other modifiers outside of the alignment changes.
Any C&C Welcome, ideally this will be used in Pathfinder RPG setting and rules.
