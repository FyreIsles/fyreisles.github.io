## The Bleak
The Bleak is a festering magical storm that warps around the Fyre Isles from the north to the south, and both in the west and east. A expanse that is chaotic and endless, the Bleak has made traveling passed the Fyre Isles a dangerous and unforgiving task, one of which no man will do willing do. Onces every 20 years the western and eastern islands are subjected to horrific destruction of a Bleakstorm as it oscillates into the Fyre Isles and back into the unknown, surviving a Bleakstorm is a tremendous feat to in its own right.

## A Godless World
No mortal believes in the exist of a god as there is no empirical evidence proving or disproving the existence of a deity in the Fyre Isles, those who believe that god does exist tend to do so in silence, as most people will posit anything "divine" can be easily explained by arcane magic.
